# JAMStack + Netlify + Astra + Cassandra ðŸ“’
*10 minutes, Beginner, [Start Building](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/todo-astra-jamstack-netlify#prerequisites)*

This is an example React To-Do application using a [DataStax Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=devplay&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=todo-astra-jamstack-netlify) free tier database.

## Objectives
* Provide a fullstack development example using Astra as the storage backendup

## How this works
Once the Astra credentials are provided, the necessary tables are created in the database. The webservice will be available on port 8080 once the application has been deployed.

[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) is a big leap forward in how we can write web applications that are easy to write, deploy, scale, and also maintain. Using this approach means that newly created content is rendered from a content API, while a static render of it is being built into the site for future.

# Running JAMStack + Netlify + Astra + Cassandra 
Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites
* git installed on your local system
* github account
* [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)

1. **Deploy to Netlify**
- <details><summary> What does the netlify deploy button do?</summary>The Netlify deploy button will:<ul>
    <li>Create a new repository for you on Github</li>
    <li>Create a site on Netlify</li>
    <li>Link the two together.</li></ul>
</details>

- Click the button to deploy:
  [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/synedra/netlify-astra-example-3todo)

    <img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-stargate/raw/main/images/tutorials/astra-create-token.gif?raw=true" />
    </details>

### 2. Access YOUR GitHub repository

  * Click on the `GitHub` in `Deploys from GitHub` to get back to your new repository.  Scroll to where you were in the README.

### 3. Launch GitPod IDE
- Click the button to launch the GitPod IDE from **YOUR** repository.

  [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)(https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)
   
### 4. Generate application token to securely connect to the database

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUTCLsBuUd4) describes the procedure to generate a token in Astra DB.

- `Client ID:` We will *not* use this during this workshop

- `Client Secret:` We will *not* use this during this workshop

- `Token:` *This is your token!* We will use it as a api Key to interact with APIS - copy it to your clipboard.

### 5. Configure and connect database
 * In the repository directory run the following command to set up your Astra DB environment. This will verify the database you created earlier or create a new one for you if it can't find your database.
 ```
 astra setup
 astra db create workshops -k netlify
 astra db create-dotenv -k workshops netlify
```

### 6. Launch your app
  * Run the application 
  ```
  netlify dev
  ```
  * The application should automatically launch in the GitPod preview pane

### 9. Connect Netlify to your site
Execute each of the commands below to link your code to your Netlify deployment.
  * First thing, we'll need to **STOP** the `netlify dev` command we issued a moment ago. In the terminal where you executed the netlify command issue a `CTRL-C` (control key + the C key) in order to stop the process.
  * Then continue with the following commands
  * This will pop up a browser to authenticate with netlify
  ```
  netlify login
  ```
  _Note, when using GitPod the preview pane will not display this properly. You must click the "open in a new window" button in the very top right of the preview pane._

  * This will link your workspace to the associated site
  ```
  netlify link
  ```

  * This will take the .env file created by astra-setup and upload it to netlify
  ```
  netlify env:import .env
  ```

<!--
  * Will be used to allow you to execute `netlify open`
  ```
  netlify sites:list
  ```
-->

### 10. Deploy to production
Now that you've hooked everything up, time to deploy to production.

  * Run
  ```
  netlify build
  ```

  * Then run
  ```
  netlify deploy --prod
  ```

  * Then finally run
  ```
  netlify open:site
  ```
  
  You've deployed your app to Netlify!
